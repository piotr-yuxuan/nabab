By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.",NVD,LOW,2.1,/AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N,LOW,3.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N,HIGH,22,,,,,,,,
